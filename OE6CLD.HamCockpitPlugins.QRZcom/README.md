# OE6CLD.HamCockpitPlugins.QRZcom
QRZ Plugin for HamCockpit from Alex, VE3NEA

This started as a first project for HamCockpit following the details provided by Alex. It retrieves information from both QRZ.com (an account is needed) and qslinfo.de, which is much more up-to-date regarding QSL information than QRZ.com. If a picture is available on QRZ.com in the top right corner (usually the QSL card), this will be shown this as well.

This is work in progress and my first project ever with C# :)
